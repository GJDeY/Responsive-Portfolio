      <p>Hi everybody! I grew up just outside of Chicago and became involved with a wide variety of activities when I
        was
        young. I played numerous sports and was always very interested in people and the way the world works. During my
        high
        school years, I excelled in academics and on the golf course. I also got my first taste of computer coding when
        I elected to
        take
        a Visual Basic class and later a Cisco computer networking class. While I did not develop an immediate passion
        for
        the aforementioned classes at the time, I did further my knowlege in this area with a computer science class
        when
        attaining my bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa where I foucsed my studies in psychology and
        business.</p>

      <p>I have been in the workforce ever since graduation in a number of different roles and jobs, ranging from
        Banking
        to logistics. Currently, I am working for a restaurant group and an event company in management, operations,
        and
        sales. I am also an avid investor and trader, particularly interseted in FinTech and AI.</p>

      <p>I am extremely excited and blessed to have been given the opportunity at Northwestern University to jump into
        a new career as a full-stack web developer! I am certainly looking forward
        to the future with the plethora of new and valuable skills I have learned!</p>
